# Buddy
Buddy lets you pair up with another player before the round begins, and spawn in on the same team as them. This can let friends play together more easily.

## Installation
To install Buddy, just download the latest release at https://github.com/PintTheDragon/Buddy/releases (make sure to get the EXILED version, not the SMOD version), then stick Buddy.dll in your EXILED Plugins folder directory. After you launch your server, you can configure it.

## Configuration
For the most part, Buddy works out of the box, but you may want to configure it.
To configure Buddy, open up your EXILED config (located in your EXILED directory, under the Config folder), then scroll down to the buddy section. It will show every config option, as well as their default values and a description of what they do.

## Usage
To use buddy plugin, run ".buddy <friend's name>" before the round starts (friend's name does not need to be exact). Then, your friend needs to run ".baccept". That's it! You will both spawn in on the same team.
